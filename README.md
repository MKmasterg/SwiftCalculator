# SwiftCalculator
A simple GUI calculator made with java swift.

# How It Works
This calculator has a model for calculating only two operands; when the user types in the first operand then hits one of the operations, the program puts it to the first operand placement; for the second operand, if the first operand placement was already in use then program would calculate the result and place it in the first operand.
This would allow the user to chain calculation its entries.
